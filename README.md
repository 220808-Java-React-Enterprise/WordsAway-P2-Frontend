### Proposal
Words Away is a web based game combining the mechanics of Battleship and Scrabble. 
This game will use a anagram API for checking words and determining possible words for computer players. 
Players will start a game by challenging another user or bot. On their turn a player can place either a 
word or a fireball. All instances of 2 or more letters in a grid must be valid words. A player receives a fireball 
for each new cross word that they make. The first player to place letters in every worm cell of their opponent's 
grid wins.

### Features
 - Players can register with a username, email, and password.
 - Players will be able to start a game with a CPU.
 - Players are able to start a game with another user
 - Each player has a “tray” of 7 letters that they can make words from.
 - Each time a letter is played, a new letter is drawn to replace it.
 - A player can skip their turn to shuffle their letters back in and receive 7 new letters.
 - A player can play a fireball if they have one instead of a word.
 - Once all the opponent’s worms have been destroyed, the remaining player is the winner.
 - Letters will have a rarity value.
